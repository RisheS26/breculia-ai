</div>

<div class="doc-body">

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By booking a demo, signing a service agreement, or using any service provided by Breculia AI ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), you ("Client," "you") agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>
<p>Breculia AI is operated by Rishe S.T, based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, serving clients across the United States and other international markets.</p>

</ul>
<p>Services are described in full in your signed Service Agreement. These Terms govern all services unless explicitly overridden in a signed agreement.</p>

<h2>3. Service Agreement & Onboarding</h2>
<p>Services begin only after: (a) a signed Service Agreement is on file, and (b) the one-time setup fee is received in full. No deployment work begins until both conditions are met.</p>
<p>Onboarding requires the Client to complete an intake form within 24 hours of payment. Delays in completing the intake form extend the deployment timeline accordingly.</p>

<h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Setup Fee:</strong> 100% due upfront before any deployment work begins. Non-refundable once deployment has commenced (see Refund Policy).</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly Retainer:</strong> Billed on the 1st of each month. Payment is due within 7 days of invoice date.</li>
  <li><strong>Overage Charges:</strong> Usage beyond your plan's included minutes is billed at your plan's overage rate ($0.20–$0.35/min). Overage is calculated monthly and added to the following month's invoice.</li>
  <li><strong>Late Payments:</strong> Accounts more than 14 days past due may result in service suspension. Suspended services are restored within 24 hours of payment receipt.</li>
  <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All pricing is in USD unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Cancellation Policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monthly retainers may be cancelled with <strong>30 days written notice</strong> sent to hello@breculia.tech.</li>
  <li>Service continues through the end of the current billing period after notice is received.</li>
  <li>Setup fees are non-refundable after deployment has commenced.</li>
  <li>Client data (call logs, Airtable records, calendar data) is provided to the Client in CSV format upon written request within 14 days of cancellation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Client agrees to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide accurate information during onboarding (business name, phone numbers, service areas, pricing, emergency contacts)</li>
  <li>Grant necessary access to Google Calendar, CRM systems, and other integrations as required</li>
  <li>Notify Breculia AI within 48 hours of any changes to business information that affect agent scripts</li>
  <li>Maintain active subscriptions to third-party tools required for service delivery (e.g., WhatsApp Business account for WhatsApp notifications)</li>
  <li>Comply with all applicable laws in their jurisdiction, including telemarketing and call recording regulations</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Call Recording & Compliance</h2>
<p>AI voice agents may record call transcripts for the purpose of quality monitoring, system improvement, and delivery of the agreed services. By using our services, the Client:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Represents that they have obtained or will obtain all legally required consents from callers in their jurisdiction for call recording</li>
  <li>Accepts responsibility for compliance with applicable state and federal laws regarding call recording (including two-party consent states such as California, Florida, Illinois)</li>
  <li>Agrees to include any required call recording disclosures in their agent scripts upon request</li>
</ul>
<p>Breculia AI will include a disclosure prompt in all agent scripts by default. Removal of this disclosure is at the Client's explicit request and risk.</p>

<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All workflow automations, agent templates, prompt engineering, and system architecture developed by Breculia AI remain the intellectual property of Breculia AI.</li>
  <li>Client-specific customizations (business name, service menu, FAQ content) are the Client's property.</li>
  <li>Client grants Breculia AI a limited license to use their business information solely for the purpose of delivering the agreed services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Breculia AI provides services on a best-effort basis. We do not guarantee:</p>
<ul>
  <li>100% uptime of third-party platforms (Retell AI, Twilio, Google Calendar, n8n)</li>
  <li>Specific revenue outcomes or lead conversion rates</li>
  <li>Uninterrupted service during third-party platform outages outside our control</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Breculia AI's total liability for any claim arising from these services shall not exceed the total monthly retainer paid in the 3 months preceding the claim.</strong></p>
<p>Breculia AI shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>

<h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during the course of the service relationship. Breculia AI will not share client business data, call records, or customer information with any third party except as required to deliver the agreed services (e.g., Retell AI for voice processing, Twilio for SMS).</p>

<h2>11. Modifications to Services</h2>
<p>Breculia AI reserves the right to modify pricing, features, or service terms with <strong>30 days written notice</strong> to active clients. Continued use of services after the notice period constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
